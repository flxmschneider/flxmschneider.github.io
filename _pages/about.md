Welcome to the course website of *Applied Data Science with Python for Beginners*!
We will use this website to distribute all course materials which we will use througout the course. You will find all slides and links to the needed Google colabs's for the lectures as well for the homeworks here.

# Trainers

- **Felix Schneider**, M.Sc Physics and Computer Science, [send me an e-mail](felix.schneider@tech-academy.io)
- **Tom Schwitzkowski**, M.Sc Business Informatics

# Course Objective
Data analysis plays a critical role in a wide range of academic disciplines and the Python programming language has become one of the standard tools within the Data Science community. This online course will introduce programming with Python in general and how to use it for data analysis. After the successful completion of this course, you will be able 
- to understand the fundamentals of the Python programming language,
- do basic data analysis in form of data wrangling
- visualization of data and applying simple statistical models to the data. 

Our goal is to show you the scope of possibilities within Python and leave you with the impression that you can confidently implement your own empirical projects in Python.

# Course Description
**This online course is aimed at beginners.** 
Hence, we will cover the fundamentals of programming with Python before we dive into the topic of Data Science. We will not cover deeper statistical/theoretical concepts in this course, as the focus will lie on the coding part. 
What you will learn:

 - Syntax and basics of Python and how to use Jupyter Notebooks as a coding environment   
 - Data analysis, data wrangling and data visualization using numpy, pandas and matplotlib   
 - Intro on how touse simple statistical models in Python using scikit-learn

# Course Organization
We will have three lectures, where we will meet via Zoom.
In this lectures we will present the topics on slides and show them in action in live-coding parts. If you have the possibility to follow the lecture on two screens (one for Zoom ans slides, and on for coding in the browser on Google colab), it is a good idea to code along in this live-coding parts to get used to the syntax of Python.
We will also add some small exercises during the class and give you time to work on them, afterwards we will present the solutions to you.


| Lecture | Date | Time| Topics
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | 27. April 2021 | 18:00 - 19:30  | Fundamentals of Python
| 2 | 04. April 2021| 18:00 - 19:30 | Data wrangling and visualizations using pandas and matplotlib
| 3|  11. April 2021| 18:00 - 19:30 | Advanced visualizations with seaborn, modeling with scikit-learn

# Preparations
We will use Google colab for the coding parts, therefore no pre-configuration or installation on your machine is necessary. To use Google colab, you need a Google account (same account which is used for gmail, YouTube, etc,...).
Furthermore, it could be helpful for you, if you can follow the course on two screens or two devices. On one screen you can do the programming exercises, the other screen can then be used for Zoom and to look at the slides.
