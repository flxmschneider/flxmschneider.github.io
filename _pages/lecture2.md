In this lecture we will learn to use the libraries numpy and pandas to work with data.
Numpy is a library for scientific computing and many other librariers are built on top of this one.
Pandas is a data analysis and manipulation tool and the best choice when working with tabular data.
At the end of this lecture we will also start to use matplotlib for simple plotting.
